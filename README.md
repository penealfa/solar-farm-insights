# Strategic Solar Investment Analysis

## **Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing environmental measurement data to identify high-potential regions for solar energy investments. The analysis explores solar radiation, temperature, wind speed, and other meteorological factors across three regions: Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The goal is to support MoonLight Energy Solutions' mission of enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability through data-driven solar investment strategies.

## **Key Features**
- Statistical analysis of solar radiation data (GHI, DNI, DHI).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations.
- Outlier detection and data cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Insights into region-specific environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
- Recommendations for prioritizing solar investments in high-potential regions.

## **Getting Started**
### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scipy`, `jupyter`

### **Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Strategic-Solar-Investment-Analysis.git
   cd Strategic-Solar-Investment-Analysis
2. Create a virtual environment and install required dependencies:
    ```bash   
      python -m venv env
      source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
      pip install -r requirements.txt
Navigate to the notebook folder to explore the Jupyter notebooks or run the scripts from the scripts folder.

### **Usage**
Notebook Folder: Contains detailed, step-by-step EDA and analysis notebooks.
Scripts Folder: Run Python scripts for preprocessing and visualizing data.
### **Results**
The analysis identifies Benin as the most promising region for solar investments, followed by Togo, with Sierra Leone as a limited investment opportunity. Detailed insights and recommendations can be found in the report.
